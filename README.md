My project was to create a system where you could take pictures of the ingredients you wanted to use
and the app would send you to a recipe that had the largest amount of your ingredients.

My current project however does not do this. Instead it allows you to scan specific ingredients and
then classifies them.

The items that are detected are stored onto a list that would have been used to find the recipes.

There were a few features that I was not able to add due to running out of time.

This was the first app I have ever created, so its a bit rough.

Items that can be detected by my model:
0 Apple
1 Avocado
2 Banana
3 Orange
4 Pineapple
5 Carrot
6 Garlic
7 Leek
8 Potato
9 Tomato
